NEXT 2024 FIAP - Scientific Initiation 2024

The project involves technology capable of using the existing fleet of drones in agribusiness to add fire detection functionality to large planting areas or forests. The technology employs artificial intelligence and neural network training for analyzing images taken by drones. Once the presence of fire is detected,
alerts are sent to farm managers via WhatsApp, and a chat with pre-defined instructions guide the user through protocols previously agreed with the authorities.

The project was already one of the finalists at AI4GOOD, a Brazilian conference between Harvard and MIT and is currently participating in the FIAP Technology Festival, the largest technology university in Brazil
